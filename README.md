# Learning Vue.js and TypeScript

In this repository, I learn **Vue.JS** and **Typescript**.  
  
## VUE.JS:
Learning Vue.JS, I created a To-do app with the following functionalities:  
-- Add new To-do
-- Strikethrough for done To-do
-- Mark all To-do's as done
-- Delete a To-do
-- Remove all To-do's
-- Styled the page with Bootstrap

## To-do:
-- Learning TypeScript
-- Integrating Typescript into the previously created To-do list app
