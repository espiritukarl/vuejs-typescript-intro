# Learning Vue.js and TypeScript

In this repository, I learn **Vue.JS** and **Typescript**.  
  
## VUE.JS:
Learning Vue.JS, I created a To-do app with the following functionalities:  
- Add new To-do
- Strikethrough for done To-do
- Mark all To-do's as done
- Delete a To-do
- Remove all To-do's
- Styled the page with Bootstrap

## To-do:
- Learning TypeScript
- Integrating Typescript into the previously created To-do list app
